For cmake to work you follow these steps:

1> make a folder named "build"(anything else it will work but it is standardly named as "build")  
2> type this [command] : "cd build"
3> type this [command] : "cmake .."
4> type this [command] : "cmake -build ."
5> type this [command] : "./Debug/todo" (this depend what you are using) ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“
